# BDSX-Manager

BDSX-Manager is a Python-based GUI wrapper for managing a BDSX Server. It has basic features such as Start, Stop, Restart, Auto-restart, and console output with commands. It also has shortcuts to various files inside the bdsx directory. You can see a player list with options to OP, DeOP, or Kick players.

# Installation

To use this simply download the BDSX-Manager.exe and place it into the main bdsx directory, it will create a config.ini file to save settings. If you have python and want to use the .py or .pyw file you will need to install the requred packages.

# Other

In the future I want to add other feature such as auto backup and chat management feature. If you have any suggestions or problems please open an issue.
