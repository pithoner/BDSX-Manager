# BDSX-Manager

BDSX-Manager is a Python-based GUI wrapper for managing a BDSX Server. It has basic features such as Start, Stop, Restart, Auto-restart, and console output with commands. It also has shortcuts to various files inside the bdsx directory. You can see a player list with options to OP, DeOP, or Kick players.

# Installation

To use this simply download the BDSX-Manager.exe from the latest release and place it into the main bdsx directory, it will create a config.ini file to save settings. You do not need to download config.ini. If you have python and want to use the .py or .pyw file you will need to install the requred packages.

# Other

In the future I want to add other features such as auto backup and chat management feature. If you have any suggestions or bugs/problems please open an issue.
